Files
*labels.dat: labels of each ice structure, the common name if it corresponds to a known phase. "None" means it is eliminated from furthur study.

In each subfolder
Gerometries that have been fully optimized using HSE-3c (very tight numerical settings)
*geom_sym.cif: Geometry with recovered space group symmetry in cif format
*geom_p1.cif: Geometry in P1 symmetry in cif format
*POSCAR: Geometry in P1 symmetry in VASP format
*kpoints.dat: minimal k-grid sized (max deviation to converged HSE-3c Elatt of 1 meV)
*hse3c/crystal.out: CRYSTAL17 output file of HSE-3c single-point calculation
